  <h3 style="color: #ddd;text-align:center;">What is Computer Science?</h3>
  <p>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) are the center disciplines of modern technology and the information age. Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computations, computational machines, and programming languages; computer engineering is the branch of engineering that integrates computer science with electrical engineering to design, develop, and create new computer software and hardware. Despite their differences, both disciplines are essential in many technological developments in our world from energy efficiency, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and medical research.</p>

  <p>It is no secret that efficiency and sustainability are some of the most relevant topics in modern technology. Every day, computer scientists and software engineers strive to develop impactful applications to make the world safer and more sustainable. Technology is being used to uphold environment-related laws and regulations; for example, conservationists have been using drones to keep sight on protected areas; in this situation, CSE is utilized in the making and controlling of the drones. Indirectly, both computer science and engineering are used as a means to allow a way for conservationists to monitor environments and those who inflict damage onto them. However, an incredible aspect of CSE is the ability to develop technological solutions to help in many different and overlapping aspects of life.</p>

  <div style="color:#ddd;background-color:#282E34;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
  <p>Some children find problem solving interesting from exposure to a variety of games at a young age from games and toys like chess, Rubik’s Cubes, and even Lego sets. Although Legos may seem simple, all puzzles and games require developmental skills and a level of creativity to get from point A to point B. It is important for kids to be exposed to problem solving at a young age as it is one of the most useful skills to have in any career especially in computer science or engineering. For example, a program called Teaching Programming and Language Concepts Using LEGOs® is an innovative method for using LEGO® bricks to teach programming and other computing concepts to elementary and middle school students. These types of exposure lead to early discovery of what interests a student may have as well as developing an interest in computer science.</p>

  <p>Artificial intelligence is the study of machine learning and how it can be related to the human brain. The world will always progress in this endless field because despite technological advances, there are still plenty of ways computers can be improved to be better machines. AI is important because it makes life easier for people in some cases. For example, the creation of speech recognition for iPhones in 2008 has revolutionized the phone industry, and Siri has since became more and more popular. Although it has not been perfected, professionals in these fields are in excellent demand.</p>

  <p>In a world with a growing population of billions of people, internet security and cybersecurity have become a high priority. Companies hire the best professionals in these fields to create safe stashes of online currency, bank accounts which require multiple methods of ensuring safe deposits and withdrawals, and social media accounts. One infamous example happened in July of 2020 when 17 year old Graham Evan Clark was charged with communication fraud and identity theft for hacking into high-profile accounts, including those of former president Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Graham reaped more than 400 bitcoin transfers for a promised offer of $100,000. As this incident has shown, having strong security systems can ensure events like these do not occur.</p>

  <p>Computer science can help medical researchers as well. In 2008, a computer game called “Foldit” was released by a computer scientist where the player was provided with a complex puzzle and was tasked to solve it. The puzzles in this game were not typical puzzles; they were virtual molecular structures of enzymes which the player could manipulate in order to design a key for a lock. If the player was able to create a solution, the key, for the molecule in question, they were awarded points. If they were able to create a key that simulates a more efficient lower energy level, they were awarded more points. Many virus-puzzles were implemented into the game and many of them were able to be solved from the public crowdsourcing of the puzzle in quick fashion. Although the game only solved specific problems that fit the criteria of the program, it proves that computer science, alongside crowdsourcing, can majorly help solve scientific challenges when utilized correctly.</p>

  <p>When talking to a graduate student about the role Computer Science Engineering had in his life, he quickly embellished his resources he attained at Lehigh University. He specifically highlighted upon the networking opportunities that turned into internships and the fundamental concepts he learned in classes that he used in his personal projects. Through the implementation of CSE 6 ^3, he was able to co-found a project with other upper class Computer Science students, aimed at teaching underclass students the basics of software engineering in an easy-to-use, digestible format.</p>

  <p>The future of computer science and engineering is bright: as an ever-growing subject, it continues to stretch its reach and influence into different fields, automating and efficiently completing tasks. Just 20 years ago, it was difficult to imagine what computers could do in their limited capabilities; now with unlimited knowledge, computers can do and perform tasks beyond many of our human expectations. Even today, people are amazed with the performance increase and power that a computer is capable of utilizing so, it’s not hard to imagine that in the future, computers are going to play an even larger role in society. As it appears, computers are getting more complex every year and are also getting closer to automating more tedious jobs.</p>
